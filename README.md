# lean-to-markdown README

This is the README for the extension "lean-to-markdown".

## Features

This extension allows you to view a Lean file as Markdown. Comments are treated as Markdown, and the code is placed in code blocks.

There are two possible commands:

- `Render Lean file in Markdown in Webview`, which displays it in Markdown without using VS-Code's built-in viewer.

- `Render Lean file in Markdown via the integrated Markdown viewer`, which creates a Markdown file with the name `temp.md`` and opens it in VS-Code's built-in viewer.
